  
\# Project Context — Geoffrey.ai

This project is a GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Micro SaaS.

Purpose:  
\- Measure how visible a company is in AI models (ChatGPT first)  
\- Generate concrete GEO improvements (FAQ, schema, AI-friendly copy)

Architecture:  
\- Lovable \= frontend  
\- Antigravity \= AI logic engine  
\- OpenAI \= primary model (gpt-4o-mini)  
\- Gemini will be added later for comparison

Important rules:  
\- Two-pass architecture (Responder → Judge)  
\- No hallucinated business facts  
\- Entity Snapshot is the single source of truth  
\- All logic must be portable outside Antigravity

Current status:  
\- OpenAI API key added to agent  
\- No production logic built yet
